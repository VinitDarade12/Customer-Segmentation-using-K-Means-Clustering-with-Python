# Customer-Segmentation-using-K-Means-Clustering-with-Python

Problem Statement: Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering with Python

Objective:
To segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior and demographic information using the K-Means Clustering algorithm in Python.
This segmentation will help businesses understand their customer base better, allowing them to tailor marketing strategies, improve customer service, and enhance product offerings.

K-Means Clustering Algorithm
K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that solves clustering problems in machine learning or data science. 
K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Learning algorithm, which groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters. 
Here K defines the number of pre-defined clusters that need to be created in the process, if K=2, there will be two clusters, and for K=3, there will be three clusters, and so on.

Dataset:
The dataset for this project can include the following features:
Customer ID
Age
Gender
Annual Income
Spending Score (1-100)
Other relevant features (e.g., frequency of purchase, product categories purchased, etc.)
